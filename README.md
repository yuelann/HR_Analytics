# HR_Analytics

The project will commence by importing data and creating an employee demographics page to present the overall demographic outlook of the organization. Pie charts and doughnut charts will be generated to visualize gender and racial diversity. In the final tasks, an employee detail page will be created to provide comprehensive information about any employee with just a click. Furthermore, buttons, themes, slicers, and filters will be explored to enhance the interactivity and utility of the dashboard.
